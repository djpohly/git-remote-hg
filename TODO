* Have revcache store deltas only and not full object text
* Implement mercutil.makebundle
* Consider using a single `cat-file --batch' to save some fork+execs
* Split calls to git into their own module, as they don't seem to rely on any
  of the other code.  Perhaps create a class to encapsulate?
* Think about everywhere that generators/generator expressions may be able to
  help performance
